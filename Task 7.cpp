/*
What did I learn? The specifics behind I/O handling in C++ and the weird handling of vector pointers in code, i.e. the pointer symbol * has a lower priority than most anything else leading to the need to use of
parentases
What did I already know? The handling of pointers and I/O opperations in general from my previous experience in C and to a lesser extent C++

What was difficult? The handling of vectors in general. I do not like vectors in execution but they are great in theory, having memory that can be dynamically allocated is great.
How was it overcome? Research and mostly brute force. More or less the same way I allways solve my programming issues.

What can be improved? The issues with task 6 subsists from the previous lab on my part. The tasks are on their part suprisingly easy compared to the previous lab.

How long did it take? 10-15 hours
